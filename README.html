<h1 id="homeappfrontend">homeAppFrontend</h1>

<p>HTML/CSS replication of iOS 10&#8217;s Home.app for use as a custom frontend for home automation systems.</p>

<p>Support planned for Domoticz, OpenHAB, and HomeAssistant, with Domoticz in testing now.</p>

<h2 id="requirements">Requirements</h2>

<ul>
<li>Node.js</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>

<ol>
<li>Clone repo or download zip to your server of choice</li>
<li><code>cd homeAppFrontend &amp;&amp; npm install</code></li>
<li>Edit <code>config.json</code> to point to your Domoticz server, and tweak other options as you see fit <em>(for iOS devices, <code>pretty = true</code> will enable a blur filter that can kill smoothness on older devices, so it&#8217;s off by default)</em></li>
<li>Once all dependencies are taken care of, run <code>npm start</code> inside the root folder and leave the terminal window open. Will run as a daemon soon just haven&#8217;t bothered.</li>
<li>From any device on your LAN, go to <code>http://serverip:3000</code> in your browser and you&#8217;re all set</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="notes">Notes</h2>

<ul>
<li>Still in early testing - only support switches (On/Off and Dimmer) so far</li>
<li>Icon support so far includes fans and lightbulbs <em>(with lightbulb being the default)</em></li>
<li>Eventually will piggyback off the webservers already running for the various backends like Domoticz, HomeAssistant, and OpenHAB instead of running its own server. Just not there yet.</li>
</ul>
